In this part, I have direct the wordluck.tk domain to this blog.

# DotTK Domains

To register a TK domain, just login to [my.dot.tk](http://my.dot.tk), and add a **FREE** domain.

Free TK domains could be hosted freely in 12 months, and will be freely renewed before they gone down.

# Direct

As you add a domain in your dot.tk domain panel, you could just direct the domain to `yourname.github.io`. The domain will be avaliable in several minutes.

Enjoy!
